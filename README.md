# SoCrapsðŸŽ²
A simple craps style game written in C++/Qt.

Work in progress to help me learn. Used Qt 5.12.8 to build the Ui. The game is modeled off casino craps. Currently there is functional pass and don't pass line bets with point, place bets and onetime bets, repeat last bet buttons. A 7 rolled clears the table. 

ðŸŽ²Deposit your play funds and roll the diceðŸŽ²
